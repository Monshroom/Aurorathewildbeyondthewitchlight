		<description>
			<p>You crept into the Witchlight Carnival as a child or youth and never looked back, earning a place among those who work behind the scenes to keep the carnival in bussiness.
				As a hand, you work hard and party hard. The carnival has borne you to many fantastic worlds, circling back around to your home world once every eight years, 
				but you know almost nothing about these worlds because you spend all your time in the carnival. You know the other hands well, but the carnival's owners— Mister Witch and Mister Light— 
				remain mysterious to you even afer all these years. Maybe you joined the carnival to escape a dismal life at home, or maybe you were enchanted by the idea of visiting new places or 
				the dream of becoming one of the carnival's star attractions. Now that you're older, carnival life has lost some of its appeal. The daily routine has grown tedious, the cyclical nature of thew carnival's journey monotonous.
				The carnival no longer fills your heart with a sense of wonder. Perhaps greater adventures await you beyond the carnival gates.</p>

			<h5>Carnival Companion</h5>
			<p>Over the years, you have earned the friendship of another carnival fixture. Roll a d8 and consult the Carnival Companion table to determine whom or what you've befriended,
			or you can choose an option that you like. Work with your DM to flesh out this friendship. This companion hangs around you while you're in the carnival , but won't voluntarily leave the carnival.
			The DM can use the Witchlight Hand stat block in chapter 1 to represent hands, performers, and animal trainers who serve as companions. Statistics for other companions appear in the Monster Manual.</p>
