			<p>Whenver you're sound asleep or in a deep trance during a long rest, a spirit of the Feywild might pay you a visit, if the DM wishes it. Determine the spirit's form by rolling on the Feywild Visitor table.
				No harm ever comes to you as a result of such visits, which can last for minuts or hours, and you remember each visit when you wake up. Conversations that occur with a visitor cna contain an number of thingsm
				from messages and insights to nonsense and red herringsm at the DM's discretion. Such conversations are always conducted in a language you can understandm even if the Feywild visitor can't speak it normally.</p>
