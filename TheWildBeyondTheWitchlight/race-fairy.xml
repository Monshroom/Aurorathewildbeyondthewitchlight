      <p>The Feywild is hime to many fantastic peoples, including fairies. Fairies are wee folk, but not nearly as much so as their pixie and sprite friends. The first fairies spoke Elviish , Goblin, or Sylvan, and encounters with human visitors prompted many of them to learn Common as well. Infused with the magic of the Feywild, most fairies look like Small elves zi9th insectile wings, but each fairy has a special physical chracteristic that sets the fairy apart. For your fairy, roll on the fey Characteristics table or choose an option from it.
